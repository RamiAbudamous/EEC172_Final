This is an example final project website for UCD EEC172 per the project
instructions [posted here](https://ucd-eec172.github.io/labs/project.html).

Disclaimer: Do note that some requirements in the project instructions may be 
missing from this example, as project instructions may change between course 
offerings.

## Usage and Publishing

This demo website uses GNU Make and Pandoc to facilitate the conversion of 
author-written markdown pages into a formatted and styled static HTML page.
It is meant for deployment on GitHub Pages, but can be deployed anywhere
that can host static pages.

After the software dependencies are installed, and you've written the page's
content in markdown, you can build the webpage by simply invoking `make` 
in your terminal at the top level of the repository.

### Usage

Create a repository from this template by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Then clone your repository locally and make edits to the template as needed.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

You can make your repository publish itself automatically by following 
[these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
